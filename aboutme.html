									<h1>This is me
									</h1>
									<p>I was born in Germany in 2004.<br />
									Since i was 14 years old i have been very interested in computer science.<br />
									For a long time i could not get myself to start coding and researching because of lazyness <br />
									but now my journey begins!</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/marius-serban-iFtuhgn7fYs-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Mostly inspired by videos of content creators like CodeBrackets, CodeMonkey and many more i wanted to start coding myself. Especially the videos of NetworkChuck which targeted hacking and cyber security got me to think about starting with computer science. But there i was missing something.</p>
								<p>The coding skills!</p>
								<p>At first i really did not know how to start into this topic. I watched a lot of videos but out of lazyness i didn't do anything myself for a long time. When got into 10th grade i had my first class in computer science but it was just the real basics. It was fun but nothing i could use for later purposes. When i joined 11th grade i chose to keep this class and it got worse. We only did diagrams but never anything about coding. And so i had to start myself.</p>
								<p>I started making my first programs in Visual Studio and when i got into 12th grade and finally we code some stuff in the NetBeans IDE.  I switched to IntelliJ Idea later on because i did not like the overall looks of NetBeans. I made a few small test programs and then it got real. I made a Sudoku solver, Minecraft Datapacks and a Discord Bot. At his point of time i am currently making this website using HTML. In school we currently work with Java and just finished with the basic data structures. Well i did use them before but practice is never bad. </p>
